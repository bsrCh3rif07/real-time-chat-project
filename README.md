Technology stack: Node.js, WebSockets, and sockets.io.   

You need to create an app where multiple users can chat together and messages get updated without refreshing the page. Yes, itâ€™s as simple as that!  

These kinds of applications include two parts- Server and client. 

Both can share data in WebSockets.  

You can later expand your chat application by adding the following features
  -      Login form     
  -      Offline/online label      
  -      Video calling  
Moreover, you can take inspiration from the features of some popular chat applications like Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger.
